// and for as short as the page and the cache writes need it (EMA module-bytes, Lyra's 168 MB module on a cold visit):
// - a read while it downloads is answered as the bytes arrive (the compile overlaps the download; it waited for the whole
//   file), and every read gets the downloaded chunks themselves instead of a copy of each (moduleStream);
// - a download that breaks or ends short after such a read was answered errors that read (no truncated module), and the file is
//   marked failed before the read wakes, so the page's fallback (wasm-loader.js: it loads the module again and compiles it from
//   bytes) and every other read of it go to the network whole, as a failed fill's did. The read is not continued from the
//   network by range: the fill's download is the sha1-qualified URL's, a range of the plain URL can come from a newer build
//   (spliced onto this build's first bytes at the same length), and a host may apply the range to an encoded (Brotli)
//   representation, so its 206 would start at the wrong decoded byte. A broken download recovered so in Chrome: READY 8.7-8.8 s vs 8.4 s healthy;
// - the chunks are detached once every page whose read was given them posts 'module-compiled' (its WebAssembly.Module exists,
//   so V8/JSC hold their own copy), or 15 s after that page's read ended if no such message comes;
// - once every cache piece is stored (its cache.put succeeded, so its Blob was readable), reads of the module move to those
//   Blobs and the download is released (fill: moduleEarly), instead of after the pieces' sha1 check and every other file's
//   writes. A piece write that fails never releases it: the download stays the read fallback. Lyra, cold, EMA host: the worker
